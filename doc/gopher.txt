gopher.vim: plugin for the Go programming language

==============================================================================
INTRODUCTION                                                          *gopher*

gopher.vim is an experimental Vim plugin for the Go programming language.

This plugin requires Go 1.11 or newer; older versions will not work as the
internal vendoring uses modules.

NOTE: see the README for some information to get started; this is only a
reference.

==============================================================================
COMMANDS                                                     *gopher-commands*

:GoSetup                                                            *:GoSetup*

        Make sure all dependent tools are downloaded and installed. Normally
        this is done automatically after you start Vim so it's not required to
        run it.
        It's still useful to run as post-install/update hook, so you don't
        have to wait for stuff to install or update on first usage.

:GoDiag[!]                                                           *:GoDiag*

        Print diagnostic information. Also see |g:gopher_debug|.

        When the [!] is included the output will be copied to the clipboard
        (|quote+| register).

:GoRename [new-ident]                                              *:GoRename*

        Rename the identifier under the cursor.

        if [new-ident] is omitted the new identifier is based on the following
        rules:

          - All caps identifiers are CamelCased (FOO_BAR -> FooBar).
          - Exported are unexported (FooBar -> fooBar).
          - Unexported are exported (fooBar -> FooBar).

        Tab completion includes the exported and unexported version.

*:GoCoverage*

        Undocumented; may disappear if I can find a good generic plugin (or
        I may write one myself).

*:GoAddTags* *:GoRemoveTags*

        Undocumented; interface will probably change.

==============================================================================

                                 default as it's comparatively resource
                                 intensive and not frequently used.
        string-fmt               Highlight formatting specifiers in strings.
