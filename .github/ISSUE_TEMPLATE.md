When reporting problems please be sure to:

1. Include the output from `:GoDiag`; use `:GoDiag!` to copy it to the clipboard.
2. Include a *minimal* vimrc to reproduce the issue, with other plugins disabled.

Pasting the output of `:GoDiag report` is the easiest, which includes all the
required information for most issues.

You will get a better and quicker answer if you spend 2 minutes including this
information!
